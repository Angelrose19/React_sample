## How does React Work?
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

React only changes what needs to be changed!

To get an overview of what React is, you can write React code directly in HTML.

But in order to use React in production, you need NPM and Node.js installed.
