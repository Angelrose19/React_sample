# Setting up a React Environment
If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first installing the create-react-app.

If you've already created the create-react-app you can skip this section.

Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal:
```text
C:\Users\Your Name>npm install -g create-react-app
```
Then you are able to create a React application, let's create one called myfirstreact.

Run this command to create a React application named myfirstreact:
```text
C:\Users\Your Name>npx create-react-app myfirstreact
```` 

The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.
